# Welcome to Behaviour Drift Project

Abrupt change and linear drift detection in the behavior of localized people with non-invasive indoor positioning techniques.

## Main Objective
To detect the change in the behavior pattern of users monitored in their own homes, through an indoor location platform.

## Specific objectives

1. To create the necessary technological platform to obtain the location data of the users.
1. To obtain data from real users over a sufficiently long period of time to make them statistically significant.
1. To model user behavior pattern using Hidden Markov Model (HMM). Transitions between states will be modeled by von Mises distribution functions.
1. Tor detect abrupt change in behavior pattern using Statistical Process Control techniques, in particular the CUSUM algorithm, on Markov’s Hidden Models.
1. To extend the CUSUM algorithm for detecting changes with linear drift over time.
1. To conduct data acquisition campaigns with real users.
1. To analyze the results obtained on real data, to improve the data acquisition process and refine algorithms.
